# Demo-Login-Page-Project
A Google-style login system built with HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. It mimics Google’s sign-in UI and stores user email and password in a database. Includes both plain-text (for testing) and secure hashed storage versions. Responsive design and simple admin panel to view stored users locally via XAMPP.
